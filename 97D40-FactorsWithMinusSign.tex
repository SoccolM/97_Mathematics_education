The sign (cf. plus sign, opposite number) rule
\begin{align}
(+a)(-b) = -(ab),
\end{align}
derived in the 
\PMlinkname{parent entry}{productofnegativenumbers} 
and concerning numbers and elements $a$, $b$ of an arbitrary 
ring, may be generalised to the following

\textbf{Theorem.}\, If the sign of one \PMlinkname{factor}{Product} in a ring product is changed, the sign of the product changes.

\textbf{Corollary 1.}\, The product of real numbers is equal to the product of their absolute values equipped with the ``$-$'' sign if the number of negative factors is odd and with ``$+$'' sign if it is even.  Especially, any odd power of a negative real number is negative and any even power of it is positive.

\textbf{Corollary 2.}\, Let us consider natural powers of a ring element.  If one changes the sign of the base, then an odd power changes its sign but an even power remains unchanged:
$$(-a)^{2n+1} = -a^{2n+1}, \quad (-a)^{2n} = a^{2n} \qquad (n \in \mathbb{N})$$
