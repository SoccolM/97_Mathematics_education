A {\sl mnemonic device\/} is a \PMlinkescapetext{word} or phrase that can help people remember something.  Mnemonic devices are especially important in teaching mathematics, as those who are not familiar with math can be overwhelmed by the \PMlinkescapetext{formulas} and methods of solving problems that they need to memorize.
