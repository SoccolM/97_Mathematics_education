In pre-college mathematics, students typically learn how to rationalize the denominator (or, in some cases, numerator) of expressions such as $\displaystyle \frac{3}{\sqrt{11}+2}$ and $\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt{x+h}-\sqrt{x-h}}{2h}$.  In \PMlinkescapetext{order} to do this, they multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by an algebraic conjugate (or, in some cases, its negative) to eliminate the \PMlinkname{square root(s)}{SquareRoot} in the appropriate part of the fraction.  Typically, the only algebraic conjugates that pre-college students encounter are those in some quadratic extension.

Most students who have advanced far enough in mathematics to encounter rationalizing denominators or numerators have also encountered some (usually Indo-European) foreign \PMlinkescapetext{language}.  Such students are familiar with the concept of \PMlinkescapetext{conjugation} of verbs, in which the ending of the verb changes to make agreement with the person and number of the subject.  A helpful mnemonic for students to \PMlinkescapetext{calculate} the algebraic conjugates that they need to use is pointing out to them that the procedure in mathematics is \PMlinkescapetext{similar} (and actually easier) than in foreign \PMlinkescapetext{languages}.  The algebraic conjugates (or their negatives) that they need are nothing more than changing the ending of the number.  For example, the way that a pre-college student is taught to rationalize the denominator of an expression such as $\displaystyle \frac{3}{\sqrt{11}+2}$ is:

\begin{center}
$\begin{array}{rl}
\displaystyle \frac{3}{\sqrt{11}+2} & \displaystyle =\frac{3}{\sqrt{11}+2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{11}-2}{\sqrt{11}-2} \\
& \\
& \displaystyle =\frac{3\sqrt{11}-6}{11-4} \\
& \\
& \displaystyle =\frac{3\sqrt{11}-6}{7} \end{array}$
\end{center}
